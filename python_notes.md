# 🐍 Python Learning: Day 2

## Today's Focus: Variables & f-strings (Theory)
Today I focused on understanding the core building blocks of Python logic. Even though I didn't write executable scripts today, I mastered the following concepts:

### 1. Variables (The Containers)
* **What they are:** Names that hold data values.
* **Security Application:** Storing system logs, IP addresses, and user permissions for analysis.
* **Syntax Rule:** Names should be descriptive (e.g., `user_ip = "192.168.1.1"`).

### 2. f-strings (Formatted String Literals)
* **What they are:** A way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`.
* **Why use them:** They make code more readable and allow for "Dynamic Reporting."
* **Example Structure:** `print(f"The status of {server_name} is: {status}")`

*Next Goal: Write a basic automation script using these concepts.*
